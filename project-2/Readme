You should all use the same format: 
First put all the files you need to submit in the project-2 directory named by your student 
number, e.g. 10302010001.
Second come to the parent directory of 10302010001, and use the following command
"tar cvf 10302010001.tar 10302010001"
to compress it to 10302010001.tar.


Note: Compiling Error means Zero Point & Standard Test Platform is Linux version 2.6.32-5-amd64 (Debian 2.6.32-31).
Make sure that your output is the same as reference output.
